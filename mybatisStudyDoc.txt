transactionManager tag
MyBatis supports two transaction managers namely JDBC and MANAGED

If we use the transaction manager of type JDBC, the application is responsible for the transaction management operations, such as, commit, roll-back, etc...

If we use the transaction manager of type MANAGED, the application server is responsible to manage the connection life cycle. It is generally used with the Web Applications.

==============================================
dataSource tag:

*UNPOOLED − For the dataSource type UNPOOLED, MyBatis simply opens and closes a connection for every database operation. It is a bit slower and generally used for the simple applications.
